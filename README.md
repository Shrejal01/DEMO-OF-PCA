Principal components are the transformed features (or axes) derived from the original dataset in Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
These components represent the directions in which the data varies the most, capturing the maximum variance in a reduced-dimensional space.
The number of components refers to how many of these transformed axes are retained for analysis, balancing dimensionality reduction and information retention.
In the repository I have also shown how changing the number of components can change the accuracy score. 
Since PCA helps in both reducing the dimensionality of the data and at the same visualize a high dimentional data in smaller dimensions. So I have added the practical example of the same.
